# RideGopher Strava Integration

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/ridegopher/strava)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/ridegopher/strava)  

### This project has been abandoned due to fear of Strava

Strava has repeatedly changed their API with no warning. They have also shut down access to several companies. Here are some examples:
* https://segmentchallenge.com/news#shutting-down
* https://wordpress.org/support/topic/strava-api-change-breaks-map/
* https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2019/07/strava-relive-cc-app-platform-dispute.html
* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/strava-api/P-SnkWvffpg

We do not wish to spend time and energy working on an app that has a high probability of being turned off.
